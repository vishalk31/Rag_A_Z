### Planets, Rockets, Astronauts, and Space Missions

Space exploration is the investigation of outer space through the use of astronomy, robotic spacecraft, and human spaceflight. Our solar system contains eight major planets, each with unique characteristics—from the rocky surface of Mars to the dense clouds of Venus and the gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn.

Rockets are essential for launching spacecraft beyond Earth’s atmosphere. They utilize powerful engines to overcome the planet’s gravitational pull, making space travel possible. Advances in rocket technology have enabled satellites, probes, and humans to reach new frontiers.

Astronauts are specially trained individuals who travel into space aboard missions such as those conducted by NASA, ESA, and other space agencies. Famous missions include Apollo 11, which landed the first humans on the Moon, and continuous research aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Space exploration continues to expand our understanding of the universe, with goals such as Mars exploration and discovering habitable exoplanets.
