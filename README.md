\# RAG Pipeline A-Z: Complete Implementation Guide



\## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementations, covering everything from basic keyword matching to production-ready systems. Built as a progressive learning journey from beginner to expert level.



\## 🚀 What's Inside

This repo is your one-stop destination for understanding and implementing every aspect of RAG systems:



\- \*\*Foundation Concepts\*\*: Basic document retrieval and keyword matching

\- \*\*Vector Embeddings\*\*: Dense representations and semantic search

\- \*\*Advanced Retrieval\*\*: KNN, HNSW, and hybrid search strategies

\- \*\*Chunking Techniques\*\*: Fixed, overlap, semantic, and dynamic chunking

\- \*\*Reranking Systems\*\*: Bi-encoders, cross-encoders, and performance optimization

\- \*\*Production Patterns\*\*: Multi-step retrieval, query expansion, and deployment strategies
